Project Overview:
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Objective
The goal of this project is to implement and train a GAN model to generate realistic images that resemble a training dataset. GANs consist of two neural networks, the Generator and the Discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through a process of adversarial learning.
GANs consist of two neural networks, the Generator and the Discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through a process of adversarial learning.

The Generator takes random noise as input and generates new data samples (images). It aims to produce images that are indistinguishable from real images in the training dataset.

The Discriminator takes an image as input and outputs a probability indicating whether the image is real (from the training dataset) or fake (generated by the Generator). It aims to correctly classify real and fake images.

The training process involves adversarial training where the Generator and Discriminator are trained in a loop. The Generator tries to fool the Discriminator, and the Discriminator tries to correctly identify real and fake images. The Generator's objective is to minimize the Discriminator's ability to distinguish between real and fake images. The Discriminator's objective is to maximize its accuracy in distinguishing real from fake images.

Binary Cross-Entropy loss is used for both the Generator and the Discriminator. The Generator's loss measures how well it fools the Discriminator. The Discriminator's loss measures its accuracy in classifying real and fake images.

To implement this project, you need to set up your environment by installing necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Then, import the required libraries to build and train the GAN.

Define the Generator and Discriminator models using Keras Sequential API. Compile the models with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.

Load and preprocess the training dataset, such as the MNIST dataset. Train the GAN by alternating between training the Discriminator and the Generator. Monitor and print the training progress.

Use the trained Generator to generate new images from random noise. Visualize the generated images to evaluate the performance of the GAN.

This project provides a foundation for understanding and implementing GANs. You can extend this framework to more complex datasets and architectures to generate more sophisticated images
